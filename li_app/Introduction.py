    Hi! This is an application to monitor the latest trands in the data science job market, for profiles similar to mine.

    Here you can see a plot of the number of job offers posted every day for the past few weeks.
    An anomaly detection algorithm runs in the backend and raises an alarm whenever the number of job offers starts to spike. The anomalies are marked by a vertical red line on the plot.

    Be sure to reach out to me before the next peak! ðŸ˜‰  

    Please be aware that this project has just started and it's a work in progress, so be sure to come back in a couple of weeks to see a better analysis. 
    
    In particular, I am currently fixing some issues in the scraping process, so the time series you are seeing are at the moment might not be reliable.
